# Predicting continental origin from genomic information on Chromosome 1. Is Machine Learning racist?

Repository for the Machine Learning assignment (VU University Amsterdam, March 2017)

The project trains an algorithm to predict the continental origin of a person given a series of SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorfisms).

The project includes a preprocessing step, and a model combining Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes classifier. Here, only the preprocessing and random forest scripts are included.

The data was downloaded from Data extracted from: the 1000 Genomes project.
